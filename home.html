    <h2>Heretic(2024)</h2>


    <h3>Two young religious women are drawn into a game of cat-and-mouse in the house of a strange man.
        DirectorScott BeckBryan WoodsStarsHugh GrantSophie ThatcherChloe East
        The latest horror film from A24 finds Hugh Grant tormenting two Mormon missionaries in his Escher-like house of
        horrors in order to test their faith. Sophie Thatcher ("Yellowjackets") and Chloe East (The Fabelmans) star as
        the unfortunate pair who must match wits with their host. Whether or not the themes of faith and religion are
        your cup of tea, Hugh Grant is clearly having a blast as the malevolent Mr. Reed and will provide some
        delightful chills.

    <h2>The Substance (2024)</h2>

    <h3>A fading celebrity takes a black-market drug: a cell-replicating substance that temporarily creates a younger,
        better version of herself.
        DirectorCoralie FargeatStarsDemi MooreMargaret QualleyDennis Quaid
        Filmmaker Coralie Fargeat (Revenge) breeds The Shining with Society to spawn a body horror with brains that
        plays like a fish-eyed ad campaign for how amazing it is to be Margaret Qualley. She plays Sue, an idealized
        iteration of fallen superstar Elisabeth Sparkle, who is Demi Moore in what could be her best performance ...
        ever? It’s certainly her most fearless and shocking to date. Upon turning 50, Sparkle is fired from her
        primetime aerobics slot, so she turns to the mysterious Substance that promises Fountain of Youth results if
        only a few simple rules are obeyed. And just like nobody can help but feed a Mogwai after midnight, directions
        are NOT followed as we fall down a nightmarish rabbit hole of women’s beauty standards, aging in Hollywood, and
        a blood-soaked finale that will delight iron-stomached cinephiles and Gwar concert-goers alike. It’s not subtle
        filmmaking whatsoever, in fact Fargeat is striking a piano with fists made of concrete. But, we adore the tune
        she’s playing.
